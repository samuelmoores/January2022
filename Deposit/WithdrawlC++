#include <iostream>

int main()

	double balance = 0;
	double input;

	std::cout << "Enter in a nonzero balance: ";
	std::cin >> balance;

		std::cout << "1 for deposit 2 for withdrawl 0 to print balance and quit";
		std::cin >> input;
		if (input == 1)
		{
			double deposit;
			std::cout << "Enter amount to deposit: ";
			std::cin >> deposit;
			balance += deposit;
		}

			double withdrawl;
			std::cout << "Enter amount to withdrawl: ";
